## Smart Farm with IoT Technology - Automated Agriculture for a Sustainable Future

### Introduction
This project aims to revolutionize farming efficiency by developing a **smart farm** with **IoT-powered automation**. Through real-time monitoring and control of key environmental factors, like soil moisture and temperature, the system provides farmers with actionable data and automated responses, reducing manual workload and improving crop yield. Our smart farm system also helps conserve resources, ultimately reducing operational costs for a more sustainable agricultural approach.

### Project Objectives
1. **Real-Time Soil Moisture Monitoring:** Enables continuous monitoring of soil moisture to support optimal plant health.
2. **IoT Connectivity for Remote Access:** Provides access to farm data from any location with internet, keeping farmers informed at all times.
3. **Automated Alerts for Low Moisture Levels:** Sends alerts when soil moisture drops below a threshold, prompting timely action.
4. **Optimized Watering Efficiency:** Minimizes risks of overwatering or underwatering, ensuring plants receive just the right amount of water.
